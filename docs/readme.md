# Airbus Aerial's RXJS Docs!!

## Introduction

**RxJS** is one of the hottest libraries in web development today. Offering a powerful, functional approach for dealing with events and with integration points into a growing number of frameworks, libraries, and utilities, the case for learning Rx has never been more appealing. Couple this with the ability to utilize your knowledge across nearly any language, having a solid grasp on reactive programming and what it can offer seems like a no-brainer. Here at Airbus Aerial, our goal is to harness the power of this library to make our code more performant and easier to read.

**But...**

Learning RxJS and reactive programming is hard. There's the multitude of concepts, large API surface, and fundamental shift in mindset from an imperative to declarative style. This site focuses on making these concepts approachable, the examples clear and easy to explore, and giving actual examples used in our own code!
